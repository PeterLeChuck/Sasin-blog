<p>We’re Saša and Peter, a Slovenian couple lurking behind Slovenia Survival Guide.</p>

<p>We act like first-time visitors.</p>

<p>Of course, we know a quite something about our beautiful hen shaped piece of land, but still, how well do we really know our homelands? Have we already discovered all the pretty places or are we just living our fast paced lives and keep thinking we could still come around here at some other time or when we grow old?</p>

…

<p>We have to admit we’re in the latter group. Always planning escapes to various places around the globe, seeing them as lifetime opportunities and thinking “when, if not now?“, while rarely taking time for the local gems.</p>
<p>With this blog we would like to take you with us while we explore Slovenia, its cuisine and random stuff and provide you with honest information about places and activities as seen through the eyes of the local. Probably some information will even be useful!</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Saša & Peter</p>
